instructions (to be deleted): # Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?
- Read about vectors and steering behaviors before trying to implement your own thing.
- I feel like I spent way too much time messing around with movement mechanics.
- My implemetation works the way I want it to but feels awkward and unintuitive.

## Was everything the game needs to have completed?
- Yes, I have a fully playable game and I am very satisfied with the results.

## The hardest part?
- taking breaks from coding when it's 1 in the morning and I have creative flow.
- I willingly lost so much sleep over this project.
- In the code itself, the hardest part was developing the generation of the dungeon.

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- There was nothing that I tried to program but couldn't figure out.
- I didn't give up on anything I had already started.
- There were some ideas such as generating different room shapes, but I realized early on that it would be too ambitious and did not attempt.

## If doing the project again, what would I do differently?
- 

## What would you say you learnt?
-
