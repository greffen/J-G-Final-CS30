# Beta-Testing

## Non-programmer's advice: Jackson's Younger Brother (Grayson)
- very fun
- could be more challenging
- could use more songs (for replay value)
- make it easier to restart
- make the song buttons display what each song is on the button 
- make a guide as to what buttons to use

## Programmer's advice: Max
- add more songs
- make a guide as to what buttons to use
- differences between each level could be more noticeable outside of sound
- could show off the frequencies somehow

## My known bugs:
- back button doesnt stop the song in gameState.GAME, so we just stopped letting you click it from the playscreen
- ending the song does not display the score nor take you anywhere
